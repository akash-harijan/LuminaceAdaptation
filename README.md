# Luminance Adaptation

This repository contains code and resources for a master thesis research project focused on luminance adaptation in human visual system. A psychophysical experiment was conducted to understand the phenomenon of Luminance adaptation and a simulation was created to find the suitable parameters for stimulus, background, and surrounding.

Here is the my master thesis, if you want to know about the details and theoritical nuances: [Effect of Luminance Adaptation on Contrast Threshold in HVS](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3092856 )
